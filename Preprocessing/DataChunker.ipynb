TRAINING WITH FIXRES: UPDATES\\nRecent research in image classiﬁcation tends towards larger\\nnetworks and higher resolution images [6, 7, 8]. For instance,\\nthe state-of-the-art in the ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 bench-\\nmark is currently held by the EfﬁcientNet-L2 [8] architecture\\nwith 480M parameters using 800×800 images for training.\\nSimilarly, the state-of-the-art model learned from scratch is\\ncurrently EfﬁcientNet-B8 [9] with 88M para\\n}<->{\\nlarly, the state-of-the-art model learned from scratch is\\ncurrently EfﬁcientNet-B8 [9] with 88M parameters using\\n672×672 images for training. In this note, we focus on the\\nEfﬁcientNet architecture [4] due to its good accuracy/cost\\ntrade-off and its popularity.\\nData augmentation is routinely employed at training time\\nto improve model generalization and reduce overﬁtting.

Derivation of the Teacher’s Update Rule\\nIn this section, we present the detailed derivation of the teacher’s update rule in Section 2.\\nMathematical Notations and Conventions.\\nSince we will work with the chain rule, we use the standard Jacobian notations.3\\nSpeciﬁcally, for a differentiable function f : Rm →Rn, and for a vector x ∈Rm, we use the notation ∂f\\n∂x ∈Rn×m to denote\\nthe Jacobian matrix of f, whose dimension is n × m\\n}<->{\\n x ∈Rm, we use the notation ∂f\\n∂x ∈Rn×m to denote\\nthe Jacobian matrix of f, whose dimension is n × m. Additionally, when we mention the Jacobian of a function f at multiple\\npoints such as x1 and x2, we will use the notations of ∂f\\n∂x\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\nx=x1 and ∂f\\n∂x\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\nx=x2.\\nFurthermore, by mathematical conventions, a vector v ∈Rn is treated as a column matrix – that is, a matrix of size n × 1.\\nFor this reason, the gradient vector of a multi-variable real-valued function is actually the transpose of of its J\\n}<->{\\n, the gradient vector of a multi-variable real-valued function is actually the transpose of of its Jacobian matrix.\\nFinally, all multiplications in this section are standard matrix multiplications. If an operand is a vector, then the operand is\\ntreated as a column matrix.\\nDimension Annotations.\\nUnderstanding that these notations and conventions might cause confusions, in the derivation\\nbelow, we annotate the dimensions of the computed quantities to ensure that there is no confusion caused to our\\n}<->{\\nnnotate the dimensions of the computed quantities to ensure that there is no confusion caused to our readers.\\nTo this end, we respectively use |S| and |T| to denote the dimensions of the parameters θS, θT . That is, θS ∈R|S|×1 and\\nθT ∈R|T |×1.\\nWe now present the derivation. Suppose that on a batch of unlabeled examples xu, the teacher samples the pseudo labels\\nbyu ∼T(xu; θT ) and the student uses (xu, byu) to update its parameter θS.
