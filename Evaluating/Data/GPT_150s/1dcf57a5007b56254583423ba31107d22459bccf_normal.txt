This peer-reviewed report evaluates a typhoon impact model developed by the Netherlands Red Cross for OCHAâ€™s anticipatory action in the Philippines. The model predicts housing damage per municipality using typhoon track and rainfall forecasts. Key findings call for clearer documentation of input data sources, model retraining frequency, performance benchmarks, and decision thresholds. Ethical concerns include missing error scores, unclear variable weighting, and potential for false negatives. Recommendations focus on transparency, reducing bias, consistent implementation plans, and improved operational readiness and decision-making support.
