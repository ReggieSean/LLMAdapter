Humanitarian data incidents involve harmful or potentially harmful events in data management affecting crisis-affected populations and organizations. These incidents may arise from data breaches, unauthorized disclosures, or misuse of data. A data incident typically includes a threat source, event, vulnerability, and impact. Effective response involves five steps: notification, classification, treatment, closure, and learning. Organizations should define incidents clearly, strengthen incident management capacity, and support continuous learning through training, SOPs, and collaboration. A risk model helps in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities, encouraging proactive and responsible data handling in humanitarian contexts.
