This guide helps humanitarians understand and use observational rainfall data like CHIRPS and ARC2, which combine satellite and station inputs. It explains data formats, limitations, and applications, such as drought detection, rainfall trends, and anomaly analysis. While highly useful for historical and pattern analysis, this data cannot predict future events or distinguish storm-specific impacts. It emphasizes using calibrated datasets and accounting for resolution, data gaps, and station limitations when analyzing rainfall.
