MEAL V2 is a simple yet powerful knowledge distillation framework that boosts vanilla ResNet-50 to over 80% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet without using common training tricks or architecture changes. It uses ensemble teacher networks, soft label supervision, and good initialization, eliminating the need for one-hot labels and weight decay. The method shows strong generalization, is effective on compact models like MobileNet and EfficientNet, and transfers well to tasks like fine-grained classification and object detection.
