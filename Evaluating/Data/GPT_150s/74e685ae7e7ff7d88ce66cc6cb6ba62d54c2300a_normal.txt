This report details the OCHA-Bucky model, a COVID-19 forecasting tool co-developed by UN OCHA and JHUAPL. It extends the SEIR framework to include age, regional vulnerability, and mobility data. Using CDC estimates, contact matrices, and road network-based mobility, the model projects infections, deaths, and hospital needs. It incorporates non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) like lockdowns and masks, and outputs weekly forecasts for humanitarian planning. Designed for low-resource settings, the open-source model supports anticipatory action in countries like Afghanistan, Somalia, and Sudan.
