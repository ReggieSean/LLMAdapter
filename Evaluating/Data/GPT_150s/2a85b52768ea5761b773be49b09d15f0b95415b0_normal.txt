This report by OCHA evaluates the feasibility of using predictive models for anticipatory humanitarian action in conflict settings. It reviews classification, risk, and continuous models, finding current conflict forecasts lack accuracy, especially for conflict onset. Recommendations include using ensemble models, integrating local data, involving human forecasters, and focusing on humanitarian impact. Transparency, model calibration, and further research are essential before operational use.
