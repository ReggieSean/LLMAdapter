This 2015 CMS report analyzes 2012 Medicare Part D enrollees using antidepressants or antipsychotics. About 29% used at least one of the two drug types. Antidepressant use was more common and skewed female, while antipsychotic users were younger and more often male. Most users took only one drug per class. Users of these drugs had more unique prescriptions and slightly higher use of analgesics and CNS medications. The study highlights demographic patterns and prescription trends but is limited by reliance on claims data.
