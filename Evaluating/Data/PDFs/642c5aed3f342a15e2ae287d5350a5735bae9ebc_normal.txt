PREFACE
Data responsibility in humanitarian action is the safe, ethical and eﬀective management 
of personal and non-personal data for operational response. It is a critical issue for the 
humanitarian system to address and the stakes are high.
The OCHA Data Responsibility Guidelines (‘the Guidelines’) oﬀer a set of principles, 
processes and tools that support data responsibility in OCHA’s work.1
The core audience for the Guidelines is OCHA staﬀ involved in managing data across OCHA’s 
core functions of coordination, advocacy, policy, humanitarian financing and information 
management, with a primary focus on the field.
The Guidelines are informed by a series of gap analysis studies, research and field testing 
conducted by OCHA over the past several years.2 This includes extensive piloting of a 
working draf3 of the Guidelines by OCHA oﬀices in ten diﬀerent response contexts in 2019 
and 2020, with support from the OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data (‘the Centre’). These 
pilots informed the revision of the Guidelines for finalization and endorsement in 2021.
The Guidelines reflect the latest global guidance and policy instructions within the United 
Nations (UN) Secretariat and the broader humanitarian system, including:
•
The Secretary-General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation4
•
The Secretary-General’s Data Strategy5
•
The Inter-Agency Standing Committee Operational Guidance on Data Responsibility6
The Guidelines also reflect forthcoming administrative issuances of the organization related 
to data protection and privacy. See Annex E for a list of the references that informed the 
development of the Guidelines and Annex F for a selection of additional resources related to 
data responsibility in humanitarian action.
The Guidelines will be revised every two years.
1     As an office within the United Nations Secretariat, OCHA is subject to applicable policies and directives of the Secretariat. 
    For the purposes of the OCHA Data Responsibility Guidelines, the term Office is used to refer to OCHA. However, references to 
    principles and actions for data responsibility within and across 'humanitarian organization(s)' apply to OCHA as an office of the 
    UN Secretariat. 
2    This includes: (a) research conducted in 2016 with the NYU Governance Lab (GovLab) and Leiden University to understand the 
    policy and privacy landscape, and to understand related best practices of partner organizations; (b) a survey conducted by the 
    Centre for Humanitarian Data in March 2018 amongst OCHA staff working with information and/or data; and (c) field research 
    conducted in 2018 with the Centre and OCHA offices to better understand how sensitive data is shared and used by OCHA staff 
    and humanitarian partners in conflict environments.

STRUCTURE OF THE GUIDELINES
The Guidelines contain five sections and a series of supporting Annexes. 
Section 1: Introduction oﬀers an overview of key concepts related to data responsibility 
in humanitarian action, explains the role of OCHA in humanitarian data management and 
clarifies the scope of the Guidelines. 
Section 2: Principles for Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action introduces the 
system-wide principles meant to inform the implementation of the Guidelines. 
Section 3: Data Responsibility in Practice provides practical guidance on how OCHA 
should support actions for data responsibility at the system-wide level, cluster/sector 
level, and organizational level (e.g. in OCHA oﬀices and in OCHA’s own data management 
activities).
  
Section 4: Accountability outlines the key roles and responsibilities for ensuring the 
adoption of the Guidelines and explains how these relate to the governance and oversight 
functions established by forthcoming administrative issuances for the United Nations 
Secretariat related to data protection and privacy.
Section 5: Services to Support Adoption of the Guidelines provides an overview of the 
services available to OCHA staﬀ implementing the Guidelines. These services are oﬀered by 
the OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data and are available upon request. 
Annex A - Definitions provides definitions of key terms used in the Guidelines.
Annex B - Principles for Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action provides a detailed 
description of the Principles.
Annex C - Data Responsibility in OCHA’s Data Management presents a set of steps that 
OCHA staﬀ should take to uphold data responsibility in a given data management activity.  
Annex D - Templates for Data Responsibility brings together the diﬀerent templates 
referenced throughout the Guidelines. Editable versions of each template are available via 
links included in this Annex.
Annex E - Foundations for Data Responsibility at OCHA presents an overview of existing 
instruments that directly or indirectly guide OCHA’s data management.
Annex F - Additional Resources oﬀers a set of references related to data responsibility in 
the sector.

HOW TO USE THE GUIDELINES
The Guidelines oﬀer an overall approach and minimum standard for data responsibility 
across OCHA. Because data responsibility varies across functions and responses, use of 
the Guidelines will take diﬀerent forms. The table below oﬀers some recommendations for 
eﬀective use of the Guidelines in diﬀerent scenarios in which OCHA staﬀ manage data.
Scenario
Emergency 
Response 
Preparedness
New response 
environment
Existing response 
environment with 
no established 
actions for data 
responsibility
Existing response 
environment with 
some established 
actions for data 
responsibility
How to use the Guidelines
Staﬀ involved in Emergency Response Preparedness should 
consider the actions included in Sections 3.1 and 3.3 of the 
Guidelines. 
•
In the Risk Profiling and Monitoring element, conduct a 
system-wide data responsibility diagnostic. 
•
In the Minimum Preparedness Actions element, develop a 
system-wide Information Sharing Protocol and Standard 
Operating Procedures for any OCHA-led data management 
activities.
•
In the Advanced Preparedness Actions and Contingency 
Planning element, develop a Standard Operating Procedure 
for Data Incident Management.
The OCHA templates in Annex D include notes on their use in 
Emergency Response Preparedness.
Staﬀ in a new response environment should focus on the system-
wide actions outlined in Section 3.1 of the Guidelines. Supporting 
these actions early in a response will set a high standard for 
data management and position OCHA as a facilitator of data 
responsibility.
Staﬀ in response environments with no established actions for 
data responsibility have two options for starting to use the 
Guidelines:
•
Start with the system-wide actions, such as an Information 
Sharing Protocol, then build down to support actions for 
data responsibility within the diﬀerent data management 
activities led or coordinated by OCHA.
•
Start by introducing actions for data responsibility in a
specific data management activity (such as a coordinated 
needs assessment) to demonstrate the value of this work, 
then initiate actions at the system-wide level.
Most protracted crisis environments where OCHA is present will 
have at least some actions for data responsibility in place. In such 
contexts, staﬀ should conduct a system-wide Data Responsibility 
Diagnostic (see Section 3.1) to determine which actions to 
prioritize.
7     Instructions for use in Emergency Response Preparedness are aligned with the IASC Guidelines on Emergency Response 
    Preparedness (draft for field testing), July 2015.

DATA RESPONSIBILITY IN HUMANITARIAN ACTION
Data is a critical component of humanitarian response. The management of data relating 
to crisis contexts, aﬀected people and humanitarian operations allows the humanitarian 
community to respond more eﬀectively and eﬀiciently. However, as organizations manage 
increasingly large volumes of data, they also face more complex challenges and risks.
Irresponsible data management in humanitarian responses can place already vulnerable 
people and communities at greater risk of harm or exploitation, e.g. by exposing their 
location or identifying a key vulnerability. This is of particular concern when humanitarian 
actors handle sensitive data8 — data that is likely to lead to harm when exposed. 
Both personal and non-personal data can be sensitive in humanitarian action. While there is 
a common understanding in the sector regarding the sensitivity of personal data, 
determining the sensitivity of non-personal data is more complex. For example, locations of 
medical facilities in conflict settings can expose patients and staﬀ to risk, whereas this data 
is typically less sensitive in natural disaster response settings. The Guidelines support OCHA 
staﬀ in determining the sensitivity of data and taking actions to ensure responsible data 
management.
In recent years we have seen the development of principles, policies and strategies for 
data responsibility in humanitarian action. These include system-wide guidance, such 
as the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Operational Guidance on Data Responsibility in 
Humanitarian Action, as well as global strategies and policies to guide data management 
within the UN system, such as the Secretary-General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation and 
forthcoming administrative issuances for the organization related to data protection and 
privacy. Despite considerable progress, gaps remain between global frameworks and their 
practical application in field operations.
The OCHA Data Responsibility Guidelines (‘the Guidelines’) are designed to help bridge 
these gaps by supporting OCHA staﬀ to apply global frameworks for data responsibility in 
their day-to-day work.
DEFINITIONS
Data responsibility is the safe, ethical and eﬀective management of personal and 
non-personal data for operational response, in accordance with established 
frameworks for personal data protection. 
•
Safe | Data management activities ensure the security of data at all times, 
respect and uphold human rights and other legal obligations, and do not cause 
harm.
•
Ethical | Data management activities are aligned with the established 
frameworks and standards for humanitarian ethics9 and data ethics. 
•
Eﬀective | Data management activities achieve the purpose(s) for which they 
were carried out. 
1.1
1. INTRODUCTION
8   See the Information Sharing Protocol template for more information on how to develop a data and information sensitivity 
    classification.
9   Humanitarian ethics has developed as a principle-based ethics grounded in the principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality 
    and independence that guide the provision of humanitarian assistance and protection. These principles and related rules are 
    enshrined in various codes of conduct now widely recognized as the basis for ethical humanitarian practice, including: The 
    Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Humanitarian Response, including the Core  Standards and Protection 
    Principles, the Core Humanitarian Standard on Quality and Accountability, and the Code of Conduct for the International Red 
    Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in Disaster Relief. For additional guidance 
    on humanitarian data ethics see The Centre for Humanitarian Data, Guidance Note: Humanitarian Data Ethics (2019).

Data responsibility requires the implementation of principled actions at all levels of a 
humanitarian response. These include for example actions to ensure data protection 
and data security, as well as strategies to mitigate risks while maximizing benefits in 
all steps of operational data management. While data responsibility is linked to data 
protection and data security, these terms are used diﬀerently.
Data protection refers to the systematic application of a set of institutional, technical 
and physical safeguards that preserve the right to privacy with respect to the 
processing of personal data.
Data security is applicable to both personal and non-personal data and refers to 
technical and organizational measures that aim to preserve the confidentiality, 
availability, and integrity of data. 
Operational data management is the design of data management activities and 
subsequent collection or receipt, storage, processing, analysis, sharing, use, and 
retention and destruction of data and information by humanitarian actors. Such 
activities occur as part of humanitarian action throughout the planning and response 
cycle across clusters/sectors and include, but are not limited to, situational analysis, 
needs assessments, population data management, registration and enrollment, case 
management, communicating with aﬀected populations, protection monitoring, and 
response monitoring and evaluation. 
Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural 
person (‘data subject’). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, 
directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an 
identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors 
specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social 
identity of that natural person.  
Non-personal data is any information which does not relate to a data subject. 
Non-personal data can be categorized in terms of origin, namely: data that has never 
related to a data subject, such as data about the context in which a response is taking 
place and data about humanitarian response actors and their activities; or data that 
was initially personal data but later made anonymous, such as data about the people 
aﬀected by the humanitarian situation and their needs, the threats and vulnerabilities 
they face, and their capacities. Non-personal data includes Demographically 
Identifiable Information (DII) i.e., data that enables the identification of groups of 
individuals by demographically defining factors, such as ethnicity, gender, age, 
occupation, religion, or location. 
Sensitive Data is classified as such based on the likelihood and severity of potential 
harm that may materialize as a result of its exposure in a particular context. Both 
personal and non-personal data can be sensitive. Many organizations have specific 
classification systems regarding what constitutes sensitive data in order to facilitate 
data management practices. 
A full list of definitions is available in Annex A.

1. INTRODUCTION
OCHA’S ROLE IN HUMANITARIAN DATA          
MANAGEMENT
OCHA plays an important and unique role in humanitarian data management across its 
core functions of advocacy, coordination, financing, information management, and policy. 
Whereas other humanitarian organizations process data primarily for their own use, OCHA’s 
data management is mainly focused on aggregation and analysis for the wider humanitarian 
community.
In most responses, UN agencies, funds and programmes, and non-governmental 
organization (NGO) partners collect cluster/sector-specific data, such as data on shelter 
requirements or food consumption, to inform their own response activities. OCHA brings 
together data from these diﬀerent partners to create a common operational picture of a 
humanitarian situation. This service helps avoid duplication and supports decision-making 
by operational and policy leaders in the field and at headquarters.
OCHA also plays a critical role in coordinating data management activities across a diverse 
group of stakeholders. With more actors engaging in crisis response, the hub and spoke 
model of coordination has shifed to a network model. In this model, OCHA continues 
to aggregate data for situational awareness but also takes on the added role of network 
enabler. OCHA’s data role in a network is to connect partners to one another through the 
provision of services such as common standards and cloud-based infrastructure for storing 
and transferring data responsibly. In the age of digital data, OCHA’s network enabler role 
must take into account the risk of hosting or acting as a passthrough for sensitive data from 
humanitarian partners and third-parties. The Guidelines are designed to support this role.

SCOPE OF THE GUIDELINES
1.3
The Guidelines apply to all operational data managed directly by OCHA, managed on OCHA’s 
behalf, or managed by humanitarian actors within activities coordinated by OCHA in 
diﬀerent responses. This includes the following types of data:
•
Data about the context in which a response is taking place (e.g., legal frameworks, 
political, social and economic conditions, infrastructure, etc.) and relevant dynamics 
in the area of focus (e.g., security incidents, protection risks, drivers and underlying 
causes/factors of the situation or crisis).
•
Data about the people aﬀected by the situation and their needs, the threats and 
vulnerabilities they face, and their capacities (e.g., needs assessment data, population 
figures, mobility data).
•
Data about the humanitarian response (e.g. 3W data, access data, community 
perception data and data on humanitarian funding). 
Common operational data management activities for OCHA include situational analysis, 
needs assessments, 3W/4W, communicating with aﬀected populations, access monitoring, 
and response monitoring and evaluation. OCHA’s management of corporate data, such as 
human resources and financial data, is regulated by existing UN Secretariat rules and is 
outside the scope of the Guidelines.
The Guidelines also address how OCHA should support the implementation of the IASC 
Operational Guidance on Data Responsibility10 at the system-wide, cluster/sector and OCHA 
oﬀice (organization) level. 
The core audience for the Guidelines is OCHA staﬀ involved in managing data across OCHA’s 
core functions, with a primary focus on the field.

2.  PRINCIPLES FOR DATA
     RESPONSIBILITY IN
     HUMANITARIAN ACTION

--------------------------------------------------
13
OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data
October 2021
The following Principles for Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action (‘the Principles’) 
are designed to inform safe, ethical and eﬀective operational data management in 
humanitarian action. They were developed and endorsed as part of the IASC Operational 
Guidance on Data Responsibility. The Principles should serve as a normative guide to OCHA 
staﬀ and partners in implementing actions for data responsibility outlined in the Guidelines. 
Implementation of these Principles is without prejudice to the privileges and immunities of 
the UN. They are presented in alphabetical order; no hierarchy is intended.
These Principles are based on a review of existing principles for data management across 
the humanitarian and development sectors.11 They are designed to reinforce humanitarians' 
overarching commitment to Do No Harm while maximizing the benefits of data.12 The 
Principles also reaﬀirm the centrality of aﬀected people and their rights and well-being in 
humanitarian action. 
The management of personal data should be informed by the principle on Personal Data 
Protection,13 while the management of non-personal data should be informed by the other 
principles. 
Wherever these Principles conflict with one another in their interpretation or application, 
they should be balanced against each other based on the particular dynamics of the 
response. In the event that the Principles conflict with either internal policies or applicable 
legal obligations, the latter take precedent.
11  A complete list of the documents analyzed by the Sub-Group on Data Responsibility is available in the IASC Operational 
    Guidance on Data Responsibility. 
12  See Mary B. Anderson, Do No Harm: How Aid Can Support Peace - Or War, (1999).

The IASC Operational Guidance on Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action recommends 
eight actions for data responsibility, summarized in the table below. The actions are 
designed for implementation at three levels in a given response: the system-wide level (e.g. 
Humanitarian Country Team, Inter-Cluster/Inter-Sector Coordination Group),
14  ‘Data impact assessment’ is a generic term that refers to multiple types of assessments, as defined in Annex A.
15  The Data and Information Sensitivity Classification indicates the level of sensitivity of different types of data and 
    information for a given response. This should be developed through a collective exercise in which different stakeholders 
    agree on what constitutes sensitive data in their context.
16  For more information on data incident management, see: OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data, Guidance Note: Data Incident 
    Management (2019).
A data responsibility diagnostic entails the 
identification and review of existing laws, 
norms, policies and standards in the 
response; processes and procedures; and 
technical tools for data management.  
A data ecosystem map provides a summary 
of major data management activities, 
including the scale, scope, and types of 
data being processed, stakeholders 
involved, data flows between diﬀerent 
actors, and processes and platforms in use.
A data asset registry provides a summary 
of the key datasets being generated and 
managed by diﬀerent actors in a response. 
A data impact assessment helps determine
the expected risks, harms and benefits, as 
well as privacy, data protection and/or 
human rights impacts of a data
management activity. 
Designing for data responsibility entails 
accounting for the Principles for Data 
Responsibility in Humanitarian Action
from the outset of a data management 
activity and monitoring adherence to the 
Principles throughout the process.
An Information Sharing Protocol (ISP) 
should include a context-specific Data
and Information Sensitivity Classification  , 
articulate common actions for data
responsibility, contain clauses on personal 
data protection if applicable and specify 
how to handle breaches to the protocol.
A data sharing agreement (DSA) establishes 
the terms and conditions that govern the 
sharing of personal data or sensitive 
non-personal data. It is primarily used for 
data sharing between two parties and 
typically established at the country level.
Managing, tracking, and communicating 
about data incidents requires standard 
operating procedures for incident 
management and a central registry or log 
that captures key details about the nature, 
severity, and resolution of each incident.
Existing coordination mechanisms can be 
used to make decisions about collective 
action for data responsibility at diﬀerent 
levels of a response. This includes the 
Humanitarian Country Team, the Inter-
Cluster Coordination Mechanism and 
clusters/sectors, among others.

OCHA’S ROLE IN SYSTEM-WIDE LEVEL ACTIONS 
FOR DATA
The system-wide level refers to the highest-level coordination structures in a given 
response, e.g. the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) and the Inter-Cluster/Inter-Sector 
Coordination Group (ICCG/ISCG). As the convener of the ICCG/ISCG and various technical 
working groups (e.g. the Information Management Working Group [IMWG], the Access 
Working Group [AWG], the Assessment & Analysis Working Group [AAWG], etc.), OCHA has 
an important role to play in supporting actions for data responsibility at the system-wide 
level. There are five actions that should be prioritized by OCHA staﬀ at the system-wide 
level. 
3.1
RESPONSIBILITY IN        
Purpose:
A system-wide data responsibility diagnostic helps identify common opportunities and 
challenges for responsible data management, informs the prioritization of actions for data
responsibility, and provides the HCT with a holistic understanding of data responsibility in 
the response.
OCHA’s Role: 
OCHA is responsible for initiating and facilitating the system-wide data responsibility 
diagnostic and presenting it to the HCT for review once finalized.
Recommended Approach: 
☐  Prepare a draf of the diagnostic based on information available using the IASC OG Data
      Responsibility Diagnostic Template. This will likely require inputs from both the 
      Coordination and Information Management (IM) teams in the oﬀice.
☐  Circulate the draf to ICCG/ISCG and IMWG members for inputs. 
☐  Consolidate inputs and finalize the draf diagnostic for collective review and validation 
      during a joint meeting of the ICCG/ISCG, the IMWG and other thematic or technical 
      working groups as relevant, e.g. the AWG and AAWG.
☐  Share the final diagnostic with the HCT and oﬀer to provide a briefing on the key findings 
      and related recommendations for data responsibility in the response. 
☐  Ideally, share the diagnostic jointly with the data ecosystem map (see below).

Purpose:
A system-wide data ecosystem map provides a summary of major data management 
activities undertaken in the response. It helps identify data gaps and possible duplication, 
supports complementarity and convergence, facilitates collaboration, and 
enables prioritization and strategic decision-making on responsible data management.
OCHA’s Role:
OCHA is responsible for supporting the relevant coordination mechanism(s) in completing 
a system-wide data ecosystem map. Upon completion, OCHA should present the ecosystem 
map to the HCT for reference. OCHA should also support periodic updates/revisions to the 
ecosystem map as the response evolves.
Recommended Approach: 
☐  Prepare an initial draf of the ecosystem map based on information available using the
      IASC OG Data Responsibility Diagnostic Template. This should be led by the IM team 
      with input and feedback from the Coordination team. 
☐  Circulate the draf data ecosystem map to IMWG members for inputs. 
☐  Consolidate inputs and finalize the draf data ecosystem map for collective review and 
      validation during a joint meeting of the ICCG/ISCG, the IMWG and other thematic or 
      technical working groups as relevant, e.g. the AWG and AAWG.
☐  Share the validated ecosystem map with the HCT for reference. As the response evolves, 
      facilitate periodic updates to the ecosystem map as necessary.

Purpose:
A system-wide Information Sharing Protocol (ISP) serves as the primary document of 
reference governing data and information sharing in a response. It includes a context-specific
Data and Information Sensitivity Classification outlining the sensitivity and related 
disclosure protocol for key data types.
OCHA’s Role:
OCHA is responsible for supporting the ICCG/ISCG and the IMWG in jointly drafing a system-
wide ISP for the response.
Recommended Approach: 
☐  Introduce the concept of developing a system-wide ISP in the relevant coordination 
      forum(s) and agree on an approach and timeline for the process with members. Circulate
      the draf to ICCG/ISCG and IMWG members for inputs.
☐  Develop an initial draf using the IASC OG Information Sharing Protocol template and 
      circulate with the ICCG/ISCG, the IMWG and other thematic or technical working groups 
      as relevant, e.g. the AWG and AAWG. 
☐  Present the ISP to the HCT for review and endorsement once it has been reviewed by the 
      ICCG/ISCG.
☐  All stakeholders involved in data management should be made aware of the ISP and their 
      respective obligations. Depending on the response, OCHA should make the endorsed ISP
      publicly available (e.g. on ReliefWeb, HRInfo or another response-specific site).

Purpose:
Tracking and communicating about data incidents fosters learning, supports coordinated 
approaches to data incident management and helps reduce the risk of incidents occurring.
OCHA’s Role:
OCHA is responsible for establishing and maintaining a registry of data incidents and 
providing periodic reports to the HCT.
Recommended Approach: 
☐  Create a registry that captures key details about the nature, severity, and resolution of 
      diﬀerent incidents. Where appropriate, this may be linked with other system-wide 
      incident monitoring processes and tools, e.g. security and access monitoring systems. 
      Limit access to the registry to prevent unnecessary disclosure of information about 
      incidents.
☐  Introduce the registry to the ICCG/ISCG and the IMWG and ensure that all relevant 
      stakeholders are aware of the process for providing inputs, including thematic or 
      technical working groups as relevant, e.g. the AWG and AAWG.
☐  Encourage inputs by the clusters/sectors on behalf of their members. Individual 
      organizations may also provide inputs based on their own incident management tracking 
      where these inputs are not already covered by contributions from the relevant cluster/
      sector.
☐  Prepare periodic reports summarizing the nature, severity and resolution tactics that
      stakeholders are using. When reporting, uphold confidentiality and do not share sensitive 
      data.

Purpose:
Coordination and collective action help the response community to monitor progress and 
identify challenges and opportunities for improving data responsibility. This also helps 
foster accountability and joint investment in the implementation of the recommended 
actions for data responsibility.
OCHA’s Role:
OCHA is responsible for providing regular updates on data responsibility to the HCT. OCHA 
should also promote alignment across clusters/sectors and between actions at the system-
wide and cluster/sector levels.
Recommended Approach: 
☐  Provide regular updates on data responsibility to the HCT. These updates should cover 
      collective progress, and challenges and opportunities for data responsibility in the response.
☐  Ensure a consolidated approach by liaising with the ICCG/ISCG, the IMWG and other 
      relevant technical working groups for inputs ahead of HCT briefings and coordinate
      follow-up actions as required.
☐  Incorporate data responsibility as a priority topic in security briefings and other relevant 
      presentations in the response.

OCHA’S ROLE IN CLUSTER/SECTOR LEVEL           
ACTIONS FOR DATA RESPONSIBILITY
Supporting data responsibility at the cluster/sector level will complement actions articulated 
at the system-wide and organization levels. Cluster/Sector Lead and Co-Lead Agencies are 
responsible for ensuring the actions for data responsibility are undertaken within the scope 
of a given cluster/sector response, in-line with the IASC Operational Guidance on Data 
Responsibility in Humanitarian Action. While the actions at this level are primarily designed 
for national-level clusters/sectors, regional clusters (covering multiple countries) and sub-
national clusters may also implement these actions in certain responses.
OCHA has no direct role in completing actions at this level but should raise awareness 
of the IASC-recommended actions for data responsibility at the cluster/sector level. OCHA 
can support cluster/sector Lead and Co-Lead Agencies through the provision of technical 
advisory support and liaising with relevant coordination structures as needed. This 
includes considering the cluster/sector level actions for data responsibility when providing 
information management support to clusters/sectors.
OCHA may also advise on the development of cluster/sector specific ISPs and other actions 
at this level. OCHA should monitor the adoption and implementation of actions for data 
responsibility at this level and promote alignment with system-wide level actions wherever 
possible.

DATA RESPONSIBILITY WITHIN OCHA OFFICES
Upholding data responsibility at the organization level in a given response setting is critical 
to the success of the actions for data responsibility at the system-wide and cluster/sector 
levels. Given the focus of this level in the IASC Operational Guidance on Data Responsibility 
in Humanitarian Action, the recommended actions for data responsibility are meant for 
OCHA oﬀices.17 Some actions at this level, such as the development of a Standard Operating 
Procedure for data incident management, will also be relevant to OCHA headquarters 
sections in their operational data management. 
There are seven actions in particular that should be prioritized by OCHA staﬀ at the oﬀice 
level. 
3.3
17  Data sharing between OCHA offices and/or with headquarters sections should be informed by the Guidelines and also 
    follow the forthcoming administrative issuances on data protection and privacy for the UN Secretariat.
Purpose:
A data responsibility diagnostic provides an overview of existing data responsibility 
measures within the OCHA oﬀice and supports prioritization of additional actions for data
responsibility in the response. Conducting a diagnostic helps OCHA gain an understanding 
of the policy and governance, tools and infrastructure, and competency and capacity related 
to data management in a response. In turn, this understanding helps prioritize subsequent 
actions for data responsibility.
Recommended Approach: 
☐  The data responsibility diagnostic should be conducted jointly by a Humanitarian Aﬀairs 
      Oﬀicer (HAO) and Information Management Oﬀicer (IMO).
☐  Use the OCHA data responsibility diagnostic template to conduct a diagnostic at this level. 
☐  Update the diagnostic on an annual basis or when circumstances and/or OCHA’s own 
      data management policies and practices change.

18  There are a variety of data cycles and processes used in documentation across OCHA’s different functions. The Guidelines 
     present this cycle set of steps to offer a frame for tips and outputs that support data responsibility within a given data  
     management activity.
Purpose:
A data asset registry provides an overview of the operational data managed by an OCHA
oﬀice promotes responsible data management within the oﬀice, and informs the cluster/
sector and system-wide data ecosystem maps.
Recommended Approach: 
☐  The data asset registry should be developed and maintained by an IMO. All staﬀ involved 
      in data management should be aware of the registry and know how to update it.
☐  The data asset registry should at a minimum include the name of each dataset managed 
      by the oﬀice, the data source, a brief description, the method for collection or receipt, the 
      storage location, accessibility of the dataset, the sensitivity classification and a timeline 
      for retention and destruction. 
☐  Data sharing should also be recorded, either in the registry or in a separate data sharing 
      log. Information on data sharing should include, at a minimum, the recipient, sharing 
      method and date of sharing.
☐  Note that data with low or no sensitivity should be retained and remain publicly available 
      by default.

Purpose:
Including data responsibility considerations in the design, implementation, monitoring and 
evaluation of data management activities helps minimize risks and maximize benefits. For 
OCHA, common operational data management activities include but are not limited to
situational analysis, coordinated needs assessments, 3W/4W, communicating with aﬀected 
populations, access monitoring, and response monitoring and evaluation (including through 
third parties). These activities typically consist of the following eight steps: Planning, 
Collecting, Receiving and Storing, Assuring Quality, Sharing, Analyzing, Presenting, Retaining 
and Destroying, and Evaluating.
Recommended Approach: 
☐  When designing a data management activity, responsible staﬀ should follow the tips along 
      the eight steps presented in the cycle on page 29 and outlined in Annex C.
☐  These tips and related outputs help staﬀ identify and mitigate risks, select appropriate
      technical tools, use and share data in safe, ethical, and eﬀective ways, and adhere to
      relevant guidance and protocols throughout a data management activity.
☐  Contact the Centre for guidance on how to adapt these tips to suit the response 
      environment and the data management activity.

personal data and, in some cases, sensitive non-personal data. For an OCHA oﬀice, such data
may include raw survey results, beneficiary lists or detailed data on access restrictions, 
among others.
Recommended Approach: 
☐  Establish data sharing agreements whenever sharing personal data or sensitive non-
      personal data with other organizations.
☐  Data sharing agreements should be developed jointly by an HAO and IMO and negotiated 
      with the data sharing partner.

      of Oﬀice.
☐  The SOP should include a process for notification, classification, treatment, and closure
      of the incident. It should also specify appropriate channels for rectification and redress 
      for individuals impacted by data incidents as determined by the forthcoming 
      administrative issuances on data protection and privacy for the UN Secretariat.
☐  Establish a data incident registry is used to capture key details about the nature, severity
      and resolution of each incident.
☐  OCHA oﬀices should share their experience in managing and mitigating data incidents

20The action ‘Support knowledge management on data responsibility within the office’ is included here as an addition to the 
    Actions for Data Responsibility at the Organization level included in the IASC Operational Guidance.
Purpose:
OCHA uses a variety of tools and guidance to support eﬀective and eﬀicient data
management (e.g. the IM Toolbox). Using the right tool helps support safe, ethical, and 
eﬀective data management, and ensure alignment with internal standards, including 
the Policy Instruction on Technology Standards.
Recommended Approach: 
☐  Staﬀ involved in data management should indicate which tools they require. The Chief of 
      IMB will monitor implementation of the Policy Instruction on Technology Standards and 
      delegate the management of OCHA specific standards to appropriate members of IMB.
☐  Use tools that are approved by the UN Oﬀice of Information and Communications 
      Technology and included in the approved list of current sofware and hardware standards
      maintained  on the OCHA IMB SharePoint page on Technology Standards.
☐  If a tool is not cleared and absolutely required for a given data management activity, 
      follow the process described on OCHA IMB SharePoint page on technology standards to

October 2021
All OCHA staﬀ and supporting personnel (e.g. contractors, stand-by partners, and 
secondments) who are authorized to manage data and related resources across OCHA 
should follow the Guidelines. Although eﬀective adoption of the Guidelines requires action 
from all OCHA staﬀ, accountability for adherence to the Guidelines rests with senior 
managers at headquarters and oﬀice level. 
The Chief of the Information Management Branch and Lead for the Information 
Management Function is accountable for the adoption of the Guidelines across OCHA. 
Every year, the Chief of the Information Management Branch will submit a report to 
the OCHA Data Steward21 on progress in the adoption of the Guidelines as well as any data 
incidents that have been reported. 
The OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data will track and support the adoption of the 
Guidelines and support the Chief of the Information Management Branch in reporting on 
progress as outlined above. The Centre will liaise with the Data Protection Focal Point(s)
as necessary to complete these tasks. The Centre will also provide regular updates to the 
global Data Responsibility Working Group22 on OCHA’s progress and lessons learned in 
implementing the Guidelines.
At the global level, all Functional Leads, and Branch or Section Chiefs whose teams 
manage data are responsible for ensuring adoption of the Guidelines. 
At the field-level, Heads of Oﬀice are responsible for ensuring adherence within their oﬀice. 
Unit Heads are responsible for ensuring the appropriate application of the Guidelines in 
OCHA’s day-to-day data management work. 
Humanitarian Aﬀairs Oﬀicers and Information Management Oﬀicers are responsible for 
supporting implementation of the Guidelines in their respective areas of focus.
The table below summarizes key responsibilities of diﬀerent groups/units in supporting 
adoption of the Guidelines.
21  The forthcoming administrative issuances for the organization related to data protection and privacy establish a set of Data 
    Protection Functions for different UN entities. These include a Data Steward (typically the head of entity) and Data 
    Protection Focal Point(s).
22 The Data Responsibility Working Group (DRWG) is a global coordination body working to advance data responsibility 
    across the humanitarian system. It brings together a diverse group of stakeholders including United Nations (UN) entities, 
    other International Organizations (IOs), Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and other stakeholders engaged in the 
    coordination and implementation of humanitarian action. The DRWG began as an Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) 
    Sub-Group in 2020 and transitioned into a system-wide working group in early 2021. The primary aim of the DRWG is to 
    coordinate, support, and monitor collective action on data responsibility, primarily through the lens of the IASC Operational 
    Guidance on Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action. Learn more about the DRWG here: https://reliefweb.int/topics/

Harm: Negative implications of a data processing initiative on the rights of a data subject, 
or a group of data subjects, including but not limited to physical and psychological harm, 
discrimination and denial of access to services.
Information management: Gathering, sharing and using data and information, 
underpinning coordination, decision-making and advocacy. 
Information product: Product derived from raw data that is organized in a way that 
conveys intended information to users (e.g., infographics, charts, maps, situation reports, 
etc.).
Microdata: Observation data on the characteristics of statistical units of a population, 
such as individuals, households, or establishments, gathered through exercises such as 
household surveys, needs assessment or monitoring activities.38
Non-personal data: Any information which does not relate to a data subject. Non-personal 
data can be categorized in terms of origin, namely: data that has never related to a data 
subject, such as data about the context in which a response is taking place and data about 
humanitarian response actors and their activities; or data that was initially personal data 
but later made anonymous, such as data about the people aﬀected by the humanitarian 
situation and their needs, the threats and vulnerabilities they face, and their capacities. 
Non-personal data includes Demographically Identifiable Information (DII) i.e., data that 
enables the identification of groups of individuals by demographically defining factors, such 
as ethnicity, gender, age, occupation, religion, or location.39
Operational data management: The design of data management activities and subsequent 
collection or receipt, storage, processing, analysis, sharing, use, and retention and 
destruction of data and information by humanitarian actors. Such activities occur as part 
of humanitarian action throughout the planning and response cycle across clusters/sectors 
and include, but are not limited to, situational analysis, needs assessments, population data 
management, registration and enrollment, case management, communicating with aﬀected 
populations, protection monitoring, and response monitoring and evaluation.40
Personal data: Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data 
subject’).An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, 
in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location 
data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, 
genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
Primary data: Data that has been generated by the researcher himself/herself, surveys, 
interviews, experiments, specially designed for understanding and solving the research 
problem at hand.41
Privacy: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, 
family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honor and reputation. 
Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.42
Re-identification: A process by which de-identified (anonymized) data becomes re-
identifiable again and thus can be traced back or linked to an individual(s) or group(s) of 
individuals through reasonably available means at the time of data re-identification.

likelihood of likely risks related to the processing of data and prevent occurrence of harms 
or otherwise minimize their magnitude and severity.
Secondary data: Data that was originally collected for a specific research purpose or 
alternatively for no specific research purpose (e.g., national census), and is now used by 
other researchers for a diﬀerent purpose.43
Sensitive data: Data classified as sensitive based on the likelihood and severity of potential 
harm that may materialize as a result of its exposure in a particular context. Both personal 
and non-personal data can be sensitive. Many organizations have specific classification 
systems regarding what constitutes sensitive data in order to facilitate data management 
practices.44 For the UN Secretariat, the classification system is defined in ST/SGB/2007/6 
on Information Sensitivity, Classification and Handling,45 and forthcoming administrative 
issuances for the organization related to data protection and privacy.

PRINCIPLES FOR DATA RESPONSIBILITY IN        
HUMANITARIAN ACTIONS47
Accountability  
In accordance with relevant applicable rules, humanitarian organizations have an 
obligation to account and accept responsibility for their data management activities. 
Humanitarian organizations are accountable to people aﬀected by crisis, to internal 
governance structures, to national and international humanitarian partners, and, if 
applicable, to national governments and regulatory bodies. To achieve their accountability 
commitments, humanitarian organizations should put in place all measures required to 
uphold and monitor adherence to these Principles. This includes establishing adequate 
policies and mechanisms and ensuring the availability of suﬀicient competencies and 
capacities, including but not limited to personnel, resource and infrastructure capacity.48
Confidentiality 
Humanitarian organizations should implement appropriate organizational safeguards and 
procedures to keep sensitive data confidential at all times. Measures should be in line with 
general confidentiality standards as well as standards specific to the humanitarian sector49
and applicable organizational policies and legal requirements, while taking into account 
the context and associated risks.   
Coordination and Collaboration
Coordinated and collaborative data management entails the meaningful inclusion of 
humanitarian partners, national and local authorities, people aﬀected by crisis, and 
other stakeholders in data management activities, all where appropriate and without 
compromising the humanitarian principles50 or these Principles. Coordination and 
collaboration should also aim to ensure that appropriate connections are established 
between humanitarian operational data management activities and longer-term 
development-oriented data processes and data investments. Local and national capacity 
should be strengthened wherever possible, and not be undermined.
Data Security
Humanitarian organizations should implement appropriate organizational and technical 
safeguards, procedures and systems to prevent, mitigate, report and respond to security 
breaches. These measures should be suﬀicient to protect against external breaches as well 
as unauthorized or inappropriate internal access or manipulation, accidental disclosure, 
damage, alteration, loss, and other risks related to data management.51 Measures should 
be adjusted based on the sensitivity of the data managed and updated as data security best 
practice develops, both for digital data and analogue data. 
ANNEX B
47 These Principles were developed and endorsed as part of the IASC Operational Guidance on Data Responsibility. The text of 
    the Principles is reproduced as endorsed, with minor additions in the form of references to OCHA-specific policies and 
    guidance where relevant. These Principles should be interpreted in-line with forthcoming administrative issuances for the 
    organization related to data protection and privacy. 
48 This includes upholding the IASC, Commitments on Accountability to Affected People and Protection from Sexual 
    Exploitation and Abuse (2017).
49 The ICRC Handbook on Data Protection in Humanitarian Action (2020) and the IASC Policy on Protection in Humanitarian 
    Action (2016) offer guidance on confidentiality. These standards should be interpreted in line with existing organizational 
    policies and guidelines. This includes forthcoming administrative issuances for the organization related to data protection and 
    privacy.
50For more information on the humanitarian principles, see OCHA on Message.
51  Data security is specifically important when transferring and sharing data.

--------------------------------------------------
41
OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data
October 2021
Defined Purpose, Necessity and Proportionality
Humanitarian data management and its related activities should have a clearly defined 
purpose. The design of processes and systems for data management should contribute 
to improved humanitarian outcomes, be consistent with relevant mandates and relevant 
rights and freedoms, and carefully balance those where needed.52 In line with the concept of 
data minimization, the management of data in humanitarian response should be relevant, 
limited and proportionate – in terms of required investment as well as identified risk – to the 
specified purpose(s).
Fairness and Legitimacy 
Humanitarian organizations should manage data in a fair and legitimate manner, in 
accordance with their mandates, the context of the response, governing instruments, 
and global norms and standards, including the humanitarian principles. Legitimate 
grounds for data management include, for example: the best interests of people aﬀected 
by crisis, consistent with the organization’s mandate; public interest in furtherance of the 
organization’s mandate; the vital interests of communities and individuals not able to make 
a determination about data management themselves; and any other legitimate ground 
specifically identified by the organization’s regulatory framework or applicable laws.   
Human Rights-Based Approach
Data management should be designed and implemented in ways that respect, protect and 
promote the fulfilment of human rights, including the fundamental freedoms and principles 
of equality and non-discrimination as defined in human rights frameworks, as well as 
the more specific right to privacy and other data-related rights, and data-specific rights 
promulgated in applicable data protection legislation and other applicable regulation.53
People-Centered and Inclusive
Aﬀected populations should be aﬀorded an opportunity to be included, represented, and 
empowered to exercise agency throughout data management whenever the operational 
context permits. Special eﬀorts should be made to support the participation and 
engagement of people who are not well represented and may be marginalized in the data 
management activity at hand (e.g., due to age, gender and other diversity factors such as 
disability, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation or other characteristics), or are otherwise 
‘invisible’, consistent with commitments to leave no one behind. A people-centered and 
inclusive approach is particularly important in the development of context-specific norms 
and standards for data management. 
Personal Data Protection
Humanitarian organizations have an obligation to adhere to (i) applicable national and 
regional data protection laws,54 or (ii) if they enjoy privileges and immunities such that 
national and regional laws do not apply to them, to their own data protection policies.55
These laws and policies contain the list of legitimate bases for the processing of personal 
data, including but not limited to consent.56 When designing data management systems, 
humanitarian organizations should meet the standards of privacy and data protection by 
design and by default. Humanitarian organizations should take personal data protection 
into consideration when developing open data frameworks. In line with their commitment 
to inclusivity and respect for human rights, they should ensure the rights of data subjects to 
be informed about the processing of their personal data, and to be able to access, correct, 
delete, or object to the processing of their personal data.
52This includes that data management must be relevant, limited and adequate to the intended purpose of data management, 
    which for non-personal data in a sensitive context must be in line with forthcoming administrative issuances for the 
    organization related to data protection and privacy.
53 As part of the United Nations Secretariat, OCHA enjoys privileges and immunities which entail that national and regional 
    legislation on the handling of data do not apply.
54 As part of the United Nations Secretariat, OCHA enjoys privileges and immunities which entail that national and regional 
    legislation on the handling of data do not apply.
55 OCHA must always manage personal data in accordance with applicable guidance, including forthcoming administrative 
    issuances for the organization related to data protection and privacy and the Personal Data Protection and Privacy Principles, 
    which should serve as a foundational framework for the processing of personal data by UN entities.
56 For more information on processing of personal data and the use of ‘consent’ as a legitimate basis in humanitarian response, 
    see the ICRC Handbook on Data Protection in Humanitarian Action (2nd edition, 2020).
ANNEX B - PRINCIPLES
FOR DATA RESPONSIBILITY
IN HUMANITARIAN ACTIONS

--------------------------------------------------
42
OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data
October 2021
Quality
Data quality should be maintained such that users and key stakeholders are able to trust 
operational data management and its resulting products. Data quality entails that data is 
relevant, accurate, timely, complete, up-to-date and interpretable, in line with the intended 
use and as appropriate within the given context. Where feasible and appropriate, and 
without compromising these Principles, organizations should strive to collect and analyze 
data by age, sex and disability disaggregation, as well as by other diversity characteristics as 
relevant to the defined purpose(s) of an activity.
Retention and Destruction 
Sensitive data should only be retained for as long as it is necessary to the specified purpose 
for which it is being managed or as required by applicable law or donor audit regulations. 
When its retention is required, safe and secure storage should be ensured to safeguard 
sensitive data from being misused or irresponsibly exposed. All other data may be retained 
indefinitely, provided that its level of sensitivity is reassessed at appropriate moments, 
that access rights can be established, and – for anonymized or aggregate data – that a 
re-identification assessment is conducted. Regardless of the sensitivity level, a retention 
schema should indicate when data should be destroyed and how to do so in a way that 
renders data retrieval impossible. Specific durations for retention should be defined where 
possible and, where this is not the case, specific periods for review of necessity should be 
set.   
Transparency
Data management in humanitarian response should be carried out in ways that oﬀer 
meaningful transparency toward stakeholders, notably aﬀected populations. This should 
include provision of information about the data management activity and its outputs, as 
well as data sharing in ways that promote genuine understanding of the data management 
activity, its purpose, intended use and sharing, as well as any associated limitations and 
risks.
